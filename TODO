- If we get stuck rotating. Slowly increase PWM
- Straighten out straight line driving
- don't close gripper if block i soff to the side
- Once we have the order of goal selction set up correctly , fix error of no path found
- when updating block locations, ignore the blocks in the construction zone
- Planning: instead of going after the first block that pops up in the world map blocks list, get the easiest block


- In Arena, make sure to set the correct block color scheme and RMC rotation PWM speeds
